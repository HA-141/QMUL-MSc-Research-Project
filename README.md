## Neural Clockworks: Decoding the Mechanisms of Temporal Dynamics with Recurrent Networks

## Problem & Motivation
Rhythmic timing is fundamental to human cognition, influencing everything from speech perception to musical performance. However, the neural mechanisms underlying how the brain maintains and perceives rhythm remain poorly understood. Prior work often relied on rule-based or entrainment-based models, which fail to capture the complexity of biological rhythmicity [[1]](#ref1).

The original Zemlianova RNN (ZRNN) model [[2]](#ref2) replicated oscillatory dynamics of rhythmic timing but required an external "context cue" signal, limiting its biological plausibility. This project aimed to address this gap by developing a fully integrated recurrent neural network capable of internally generating the necessary context cues for rhythmic perception.

## Approach
The project developed and integrated two key components:

**Period-Predicting RNN (PRNN):**
* A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based architecture trained to infer the period of an input rhythm from its impulse timing.
* Outputs a signal that predicts the periodicity of the input, enabling internal generation of the context cue.

**Integrated ZRNN (IZRNN):**
* Combines the PRNN with the original ZRNN to create a fully self-sustaining model.
* Requires only the rhythm's impulse times as input, eliminating the need for external context cues.

**Key technical choices included:**
* Using LSTM architecture for its superior long-term memory capabilities in handling variable-length sequences.
* Implementing biological constraints such as excitatory/inhibitory neuron dynamics to align with neurophysiological findings.
* Employing PCA and raster plot analysis to study hidden layer dynamics and validate biological plausibility.

## Results
The project achieved several key results, visualized through detailed figures and analyses:

### PRNN Performance
**Training & Validation Loss:** Tracking training and validation losses (calculated using mean-squared error) revealed how well the PRNN model learned patterns and generalized to different beat frequencies. The loss curves indicated effective learning without signs of overfitting.

**Key Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error = 0.0159, R² coefficient = 0.9972.

**Predicted vs True Period:** Scatter plots showed PRNN predictions against true values, with a fitted regression line closely aligning with the ideal prediction line (y=x). This demonstrated strong predictive accuracy across different periods.

**Predicted Period Over Time:** Line graphs mapped out the PRNN's predicted vs true period for six samples throughout their full duration. These visualizations revealed consistent tracking of periodicity, even during extended continuation phases.

### Neuron Activation Analysis
Raster plots provided insights into hidden layer dynamics:

* Color-coded positive and negative activations highlighted rhythmic patterns during both synchronisation (input pulses) and continuation phases (no input).
* Example raster plots for periods of 0.2s, 0.6s, and 0.95s demonstrated how the model maintained stable internal representations across different temporal scales.

### PCA Trajectory Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed the low-dimensional structure of hidden layer dynamics:

### 2D & 3D PCA Plots:

* Colored trajectories showed stimulus frequency-dependent patterns, with black dots marking tap times.
* Yellow and red dots marked trajectory start and end points, respectively.
* Dashed lines represented synchronisation phase trajectories, while solid lines showed continuation phase dynamics.

### Mean vs Standard Deviation of Trajectories:

Line graphs displayed the relationship between mean trajectory length and standard deviation for different stimulus periods, highlighting consistent internal representations across frequencies.

### IZRNN Dynamics
The integrated model replicated key features of the original ZRNN while operating with internally generated context cues.

Hidden layer activity exhibited oscillatory patterns consistent with biological neural populations, including distinct excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations.

### Outcome
This work successfully addressed the limitation of the original ZRNN by developing a fully integrated model capable of internally generating context cues for rhythmic perception, requiring only impulse timing as input rather than an external context signal.

**Biological Plausibility:**
Comparing the IZRNN's hidden layer activity and PCA trajectory structure against the original ZRNN revealed strong characteristic similarity between the two — the integrated model reproduced comparable firing dynamics and trajectory geometry despite generating its own context cue internally, suggesting the internally-generated signal is a functionally adequate substitute for the external one.

**Technical Advancements:**
The integration of PRNN and ZRNN demonstrates the feasibility of building a self-sustaining recurrent network that mimics biological temporal processing without external scaffolding.

**Limitations & Future Directions:**
* The PRNN showed a gradual overestimation drift during continuation phases, contrasting with biological underestimation trends — addressing this is a clear next step.
* The current implementation is limited to isochronous rhythms; extending to more complex rhythmic patterns remains open.
* A fully integrated (joint) training process, rather than training PRNN and ZRNN separately, could further improve biological realism.

This project provides a foundation for future research into rhythm perception, temporal prediction, and motor timing, and the accompanying codebase is structured to let others reproduce, validate, and extend the work.
