A modified ZRNN model based on Iran Roman's ZRNN:
https://github.com/iranroman/ZemlianovaRNN

This model is a PyTorch implementation of the model described in the 2024 paper "A Recurrent Neural Network for Rhythmic Timing" by Klavdia Zemlianova, Amit Bose, & John Rinzel. 
The model has been adapted from Iran Roman's model to explore and demonstrate the neural mechanisms behind the generation of the context cue signal needed for internal rhythmic timing.
